# How I found it
So I was using gn-math (using the cdn in a google site) and I realized that the comments were padlet, even though my school had blocked padlet. This led me to wonder if the cdn was using a proxy to view the content or something like that (idk how cdns actuallty work). So I created this, and it worked!
